## Installing MidiInChecker2
 * You don't have to install MidiInChecker2.
 * You simply put "MidiInChecker2.exe" to any floder you want to.
  (MidiInChecker2.exe works withour any DLLs (FDK.DLL etc))

## Uninstalling
 * Remove MidiInChcker2.exe.
  (MidiInChecker2 doesn't use registry.)


## How to use
 * Connect PC and E-Drums with MIDI I/F. Then Run MidiInChcker2, and Hit any pad in E-Drums.
  In case PC and E-Drumes are connected successfully, MidiInChecker2 shows logs whenever
  you hit pad.
  Usually, 1 pad-hit will invoke 2 logs (Note on, Note off) with pad-related Note number.
  (In some E-drums models, or In some E-drums settings, E-drums may not output Note-off)

 * If no logs are output whenver you hit any e-drums pads, it means you failed connecting
  between PC and e-drums.
  Please check
   * [MIDI-IN] (or [TO MIDI-OUT]) of PC(or USB-MIDI)
     and  
     [MIDI-OUT] of E-drums.
     are connected.
  If it's no problem, then Power-Off E-drums, and power-On e-drums. (In other words, reboot e-drums)

  If you connect both USB (PC and E-Drums), then check USB connection, and reboot E-drums.

## Notice
 * You'll need some MIDI knowledge, if you want to understand the output of MidiInChecker2 well.
